## Cloud Intelligence Dashboards Customizations

Now that you have the Cloud Intelligence Dashboards deployed, you can follow some of these steps to see how you can customize your deployment to suit your needs. The amount of customization you can do is unlimited, so here we will attempt to show you how to get started with some common customization requests. Have an idea for another one - please send it to us at the e-mail address above. 

### Customization Prerequisites

The first step to customizing your dashboards is to make sure you save your QuickSight dashboard as an Analysis.

1. Visit your dashboard and in the top right, click **share** dashboard, then **share dashboard**.

2. Give yourself *save as* permissions and click back to dashboard.

3. Refresh your browser. A new button on the top right should appear labeled **save as**. Click it and give your new Analysis a name. You have now created an editable fork of the dashboard. Your template will remain unchanged.
