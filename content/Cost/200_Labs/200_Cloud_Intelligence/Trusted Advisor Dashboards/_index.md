## Introduction
Amazon Trusted Advisor helps you optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce over all costs, and monitors service limits. Organizational view lets you view Trusted Advisor check for all accounts in your AWS Organizations. The only way to visualize the organizational view is to use the TAO dashboard. The TAO dashboard is a set of visualizations that provide comprehensive details and trends across your entire AWS Organization. Out-of-the-box benefits of the TAO dashboard include (but are not limited to):

* Quickly locate accounts and users that haven't rotated their AWS IAM keys
* Identify idle and underutilized resources by cost or account
* See a list of accounts that have reached over 80% of individual service limits
