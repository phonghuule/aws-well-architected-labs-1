### I need to edit my StackSet
{{%expand "Click here to expand step by step instructions" %}}

If, when you deployed your StackSets, you chose to deploy to all accounts and you now wish to edit you will need to get your **Root ID**.

This can be found in your AWS Organizations part of the console.

### Why should I have a separate cost account?
{{%expand "Click here to expand for more information" %}}

There are two main reasons for this:

1. We recommend customer avoid deploying workloads to the organization’s management account in general:

"Since privileged operations can be performed within an organization’s management account and SCPs do not apply to the management account, we recommend that you limit access to an organization’s management account. You should also limit the cloud resources and data contained in the management account to only those that must be managed in the management account." from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/design-principles-for-organizing-your-aws-accounts.html)
 

2. As there are lambda function deployed in the account these could benefit from Compute Savings plans. This means that there could be higher savings missed in other accounts because they are used on the lambdas first:

"In a Consolidated Billing Family, Savings Plans are applied first to the owner account's usage, and then to other accounts' usage. This occurs only if you have sharing enabled." from [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-applying.html)

### My Athena database has tables in called year and payer
{{%expand "Click here to expand step by step instructions" %}}

We have upgraded the lab to work for multi-payers. For this we added a new partition of payer_id=your_payer_id which can upset the crawler.

To fix please follow the steps below:

1. Ensure your costoptimization bucket does have the new **payer_id=your_payer_id** folder in your data. 
2. Delete your new tables with names that have long hashs attached to them and start with payer or year
3. Run the following python script [Link to Code](/Cost/300_Optimization_Data_Collection/Code/source/s3_backwards_comp.py) 

   ```python3 s3_backwards_comp.py <payer_id> <ODC_your_bucket_name> ```
   
   This will move all current files into the new format
4. Run your crawlers to update your tables
