CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.

### Account

#### Query Description
This query will provide monthly unblended and amortized costs per linked account for all services.  The query includes ri_sp_trueup and ri_sp_upfront_fees columns to allow you to visualize the difference between unblended and amortized costs.  Unblended cost equals usage plus upfront fees.  Amortized cost equals usage plus the portion of upfront fees applicable to the period (both used and unused). True-up therefore represents the difference between total upfront fees incurred in the period using an unblended/cash-based accounting model, and the smaller portion of upfront fees applicable to the period using an amortized/accrual-based accounting model. This query excludes discounts, credits, refunds and taxes, as well as Route 53 Domains usage type due to differences in how usage date is recorded between Cost Explorer and CUR. 

**Notes:** 
* Charges for the current billing month may differ slightly when comparing between Cost Explorer and CUR due to differences in how [current month charges are estimated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html#how-cur-works). Charges will match between Cost Explorer and CUR once billing has been finalized at the close of the month.

* This query expects that you have reserved instances purchased within at least one of the accounts.  Running this query as is without reserved instances in the CUR data set will result in an error. To use this query without reserved instances, remove or comment out lines containing `reservation_reservation_a_r_n`.

### Region

#### Query Description
This query will provide monthly unblended and amortized costs per linked account for all services by region where the service is operating.  The query includes ri_sp_trueup and ri_sp_upfront_fees columns to allow you to visualize the difference between unblended and amortized costs.  Unblended cost equals usage plus upfront fees.  Amortized cost equals usage plus the portion of upfront fees applicable to the period (both used and unused). True-up therefore represents the difference between total upfront fees incurred in the period using an unblended/cash-based accounting model, and the smaller portion of upfront fees applicable to the period using an amortized/accrual-based accounting model. This query excludes discounts, credits, refunds and taxes, as well as Route 53 Domains usage type due to differences in how usage date is recorded between Cost Explorer and CUR. 

**Notes:** 
* Charges for the current billing month may differ slightly when comparing between Cost Explorer and CUR due to differences in how [current month charges are estimated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html#how-cur-works).

### Service

#### Query Description
This query will provide monthly unblended and amortized costs per linked account for all services by service.  Data Transfer is also broken out for each service.  The query includes ri_sp_trueup and ri_sp_upfront_fees columns to allow you to visualize the difference between unblended and amortized costs.  Unblended cost equals usage plus upfront fees.  Amortized cost equals usage plus the portion of upfront fees applicable to the period (both used and unused). True-up therefore represents the difference between total upfront fees incurred in the period using an unblended/cash-based accounting model, and the smaller portion of upfront fees applicable to the period using an amortized/accrual-based accounting model. This query excludes discounts, credits, refunds and taxes, as well as Route 53 Domains usage type due to differences in how usage date is recorded between Cost Explorer and CUR. 

**Notes:** 
* Charges for the current billing month may differ slightly when comparing between Cost Explorer and CUR due to differences in how [current month charges are estimated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html#how-cur-works). Charges will match between Cost Explorer and CUR once billing has been finalized at the close of the month.

* This query expects that you have reserved instances purchased within at least one of the accounts.  Running this query as is without reserved instances in the CUR data set will result in an error. To use this query without reserved instances, remove or comment out lines containing `reservation_reservation_a_r_n`.

### Premium Support Chargeback by Accounts

#### Query Description
This query will provide a monthly individual account chargeback for the premium support cost based on its contribution to overall AWS bill. This query computes the total monthly aws bill (without tax and support charges) and then calculates just the support charges. Based on the Individual accounts usage/spend percentage, its equivalent support fee is computed.

### Cost by Charge type

#### Query Description
This query will aggregate charge types for one or more payers.  For more information on various charge types please reference our [Cost Explorer documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-filtering.html).  This query will replicate Cost Explorer results when filtering by charge type in the cost explore filters as shown below.

![Images/cost-explorer-charge-type-view.png](/Cost/300_CUR_Queries/Images/Global/cost-explorer-charge-type-view.png)

In order to obtain more granular data, try adding the column 'line_item_line_item_description' into the SELECT and Group By Sections (see example #2). 

**Note:** This query expects that you have reserved instances purchased within at least one of the accounts.  This query will not run correctly without reserved instances within the CUR data set.

### Serverless Product Spend

#### Query Description
This query will provide monthly unblended cost for all [Serverless products](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) in use across all regions.  This query is helpful in tracking Serverless product adoption as application teams modernize their applications.  You can expand the query to include line_item_usage_account_id to show individual service charges per linked account.  This query helps provide a view that is difficult to achieve within Cost Explorer.
