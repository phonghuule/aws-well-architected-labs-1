CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.

### Refund and Credit Detail

#### Query Description
This query provides a list of refunds and credits issued. Output is grouped by payer, linked account, month, line item type, service, and line item description. This allows for analysis of refunds and credits along any of these grouped dimensions. For example, "what refunds or credits were issued to account 111122223333 for service ABC in January 2022?" or "what was the total refund issued across all accounts for payer 444455556666 with line item description XYZ?"

### Reservation Savings

#### Query Description
This query provides an aggregated report of savings from purchased reservations across multiple services - EC2, Elasticache, OpenSearch (formerly Amazon ElasticSearch), and RDS. This is similar to what can be found in Cost Explorer Reservation Utilization reports, except aggregated across all services offering reservations, allowing for easier organizational reporting on total savings. Output can be used to identify savings per specific reservation ARN, as well as savings per service, savings per linked account, savings per region, and savings per specific instance/node type.

#### Pricing
Please refer to the relevant service reservation pricing page. 
* [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing/)
* [ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=5#Reserved_Nodes)
