CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.

### Amazon Aurora Global Database

#### Query Description
This query provides a breakdown of costs associated with an Aurora Global Database deployment, excluding backup costs. Output will be grouped by day, account, charge type, usage type, operation, description, and resource ID. Output will be sorted by day, then cost (descending).

Aurora Global Databases are comprised of multiple components, each of which appears as a separate line item in CUR. There is no overarching Aurora Global Database resource ID that can be used to filter query output. This means to get an accurate picture of a specific Aurora Global DB deployment, the relevant cluster and database instance resource IDs in each region where the database is replicated must be added to the WHERE filter. Placeholder variables indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (${ }) appear where resource IDs should be inserted. Placeholder variables must be replaced before the query will run. Note that depending on your deployment model, you may need to add or remove lines from the WHERE filter as indicated.

Resource IDs can be retrieved through the console, CLI, SDK, or other tools, as normal. If you only have access to CUR, consider the simple query ```SELECT DISTINCT(line_item_resource_id) FROM ${table_name} WHERE line_item_product_code = 'AmazonRDS'``` which will turn up a list of RDS resource IDs. Even in smaller environments the number of resource IDs returned may make it challenging to identify the right resource IDs. In that case, consider adding additional columns to help differentiate and identify the correct resource, such as columns with [user-defined cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/resource-tags-columns.html). For example, ```SELECT DISTINCT(line_item_resource_id), resource_tags_user_name, resource_tags_user_cost_center FROM ${table_name} WHERE line_item_product_code = 'AmazonRDS'```. 

Consider the following Aurora Global DB deployment example:
* Primary Region 
    * Primary writer instance 
    * One reader instance
* Secondary Region 1
  * Three reader instances
* Secondary Region 2
  * Zero instances (headless)

In this example, the following resource IDs would be needed: 
  * Primary region cluster ID 
  * Primary region writer instance name 
  * Primary region reader instance name
  * Secondary region 1 cluster ID
  * Secondary region 1 reader1 instance name
  * Secondary region 1 reader2 instance name
  * Secondary region 1 reader3 instance name
  * Secondary region 2 cluster ID

### Amazon RDS - Monthly Cost grouped by Usage Type and Resource Tag

#### Query Description
This query will output the total monthly blended costs for RDS grouped by usage type and a specified tag (e.g. Environment:Test,Dev,Prod).  The query can be modified to adjust the Cost dataset from [Blended to Unblended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/con-bill-blended-rates.html#Blended_CB) by adjusting the specified cost column (line_item_blended_cost -> line_item_unblended_cost).  This query would be helpful to visualize a quick monthly breakdown of cost components for RDS usage with a specific tag (Environment:Test,Dev,Prod).  

#### Pricing

### Amazon Redshift

#### Query Description
This query will provide daily unblended and amortized cost as well as usage information per linked account for Amazon Redshift.  The output will include detailed information about the resource id (cluster name), usage type, and API operation.  The usage amount and cost will be summed and the cost will be in descending order. This query includes RI and SP true up which will show any upfront fees to the account that purchased the pricing model.

#### Pricing
Please refer to the [Redshift pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/). Please refer to the [Redshift Cost Optimization Whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/amazon-redshift-cost-optimization.pdf) for Cost Optimization techniques.
