 The Well-Architected Framework Reviews are conducted per workload. A workload is a collection of resources and code that delivers business value, such as a customer-facing application or a backend process. 
 
1. We will start with creating a workload in the Well-Architected Tool. Click **Define workload** associated with the necessary AWS tags.

2. Now you can [define a workload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/define-workload.html):
 
![Section3 DefiningAWorkload](/watool/200_Integration_with_AWS_Compute_Optimizer_and_AWS_Trusted_Advisor/Images/section3/DefiningAWorkload.png)
 
The following are the required workload properties:
 
* workload-name - This is a unique identifier for the workload. Must be between 3 and 100 characters.
* description - A brief description of the workload. Must be between 3 and 250 characters.
* review-owner - The name, email address, or identifier for the primary individual or group that owns the review process. Must be between 3 and 255 characters.
* environment - The environment in which your workload runs. This must either be PRODUCTION or PREPRODUCTION
* aws-regions - The aws-regions in which your workload runs (us-east-1, etc).
* lenses - The list of lenses associated with the workload. All workloads must include the "wellarchitected" lens as a base, but can include additional lenses. 

3. To enable the integration with Trusted Advisor, after the necessary workload information has been entered, within the <b>AWS Trusted Advisor‚Äù section</b>, tick on <b>Activate Trusted Advisor</b>

4. Choose the lenses that apply to this workload. **AWS Well-Architected Framework** has been selected by default.
